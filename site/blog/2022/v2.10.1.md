## [v2.10.1](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v2.10.1) (2021-09-14)

Hi, data friends!

It’s time for a [new patch release](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v2.10.1) with some important fixes and a few minor improvements.

### Fixes

- Macros weren’t working; now they are!
- Repeat commands were broken, and now are fixed.
- Changes needed for the Guix build have been merged in.

### Improvements

- Added a new command `zo` (`open-cell`) to open a file or URL from a path in the current cell.
- Added a new command `guard-sheet-off` to unguard sheets. (Thanks to [Janek Schleicher](https://github.com/hanfried) for [that PR](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/pull/1517)!)
- Added an option to disable histograms with `disp_histlen` (if `0`) or `disp_histogram` (if empty string).
- Added new decorators `@Extensible.before` and `@Extensible.after` to simplify extending existing functions.
- Fixed other bugs (see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#v2101-2022-09-12) for a complete list).

### More Contributors

I am happy to see more individuals contributing to VisiData over time. In this release, fewer than 50% of commits (13/28) in this release were authored by me (Saul)!
