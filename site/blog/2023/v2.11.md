## [v2.11](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v2.11) (2023-01-13)

Hi, friends of VisiData!

I’m happy to announce a new maintenance release 2.11. This will be the last release before some big, exciting changes introduced in 3.0.

The most significant change is that 2.11 *drops support for Python 3.6* and *adds support for Python 3.11*.

2.11 also includes several other small improvements and bug fixes, of which I’ll highlight two:

- `dup-sheet` now carries over attributes of columns added by `add-column` (helpful!)
 - We added a new "concat" jointype. This behaves similar to "append", but keeps first sheet type and columns.

Please see [the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/v2.11/CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of changes.
